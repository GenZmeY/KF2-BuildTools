# Features:
- Build, brew, test and upload to Steam Workshop;
- No need to edit KFEditor.ini at all;
- Sources can be stored in any path;
- Easily switch between different projects.

# Requirements
- [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

# Add to your project
Make sure that the location of folders and files in your project is as follows (Correct it if it's not):  
`/<PackageName>/Classes/*.uc`

**There are two ways to add KF2-BuildTools to your project:**  
## 1. As [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
Open git-bash and go to your project: `cd <your_project_path>`  
Add submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-BuildTools tools`  

**updating build tools:**  
Get updates: `pushd tools && git pull && popd`  
Commit the changes: `git add tools && git commit -m 'update tools'`  

## 2. As standalone script
Just create a `tools` folder and put [builder](builder) there.  
Now you can use the script in the same way as in the first case, but you will have to update it yourself.  

# Usage
Available commands can be found here: [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)  

If you have a simple mutator or game mode, then the usage is also simple: just use [the commands](USAGE.md) to compile, test and upload to the steam workshop.

## The result can be found here:
**Compiled packages:**  
`C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Unpublished\`  

**Brewed packages:**  
`C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Published\`  

**Uploaded packages:**  
your steam workshop ðŸ™ƒ  

# Usage (Advanced)
If your project contains several mutators, *.upk files, external dependencies, or you want to customize the whole process in more detail, then this section is for you. 

## Setup
When you run compilation for the first time or do `./tools/builder --init` `builder.cfg` appears in your project folder.  
Edit it to set build/test/upload options. The config contains the necessary comments inside.  

Edit the files in the PublicationContent folder - they are responsible for the description in the Steam Workshop.  

## Project filesystem
If you have *.upk or localization files, they must be in a specific location.  

Change the filesystem of the project to such a form that everything works correctly:  
```
/Localization
    /INT
        *.int
/PublicationContent
    preview.png
    description.txt
    tags.txt
    title.txt
/SomePackageName1
    *.upk
    /Classes
        *.uc
        *.upkg
/SomePackageName2
    *.upk
    /Classes
        *.uc
        *.upkg
/Config
    *.ini
/tools
    builder
builder.cfg
```

## Examples
[LightTIM](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-LightTIM) - simplest case (one mutator)  
[ServerExt](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-Server-Extension) - Two mutators are compiled, there are *.upk files and localization  
[UnofficialMod](https://github.com/GenZmeY/UnofficialMod) - Three mutators are compiled (one of them is a dependency), two mutators are uploaded to the steam workshop

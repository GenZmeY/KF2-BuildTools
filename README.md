# Features:
- Build, brew, test and upload to Steam Workshop;
- No need to edit KFEditor.ini at all;
- Sources can be stored in any path;
- Easily switch between different projects.

# Requirements
- [Killing Floor 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/232090/Killing_Floor_2/);
- Killing Floor 2 - SDK;
- [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

# Limits
You can keep mod sources anywhere, but `Killing Floor 2` and `Killing Floor 2 - SDK` must be installed on the system drive (C:\ in most cases).  

(I plan to fix this limitation in the future)

# Add to your project
Make sure that the location of folders and files in your project as follows (Correct it if it's not):  
`/<PackageName>/Classes/*.uc`

**There are two ways to add KF2-BuildTools to your project:**  
## 1. As [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
Open git-bash and go to your project: `cd <your_project_path>`  
Add submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-BuildTools tools`  

**updating build tools:**  
Get updates: `pushd tools && git pull && popd`  
Commit the changes: `git add tools && git commit -m 'update tools'`  

## 2. As standalone script
Just create a `tools` folder and put [builder](builder) there.  
Now you can use the script in the same way as in the first case, but you will have to update it yourself.  

# Usage
Available commands can be found here: [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)  

If you have a simple mutator or game mode, then the usage is also simple: just use [the commands](USAGE.md) to compile, test and upload to the steam workshop.

## The result can be found here:
**Compiled packages:**  
`C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Unpublished\`  

**Brewed packages:**  
`C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Published\`  

**Uploaded packages:**  
your steam workshop ðŸ™ƒ  

# Usage (Advanced)
If your project contains several mutators, *.upk files, external dependencies, or you want to customize the whole process in more details, then this section is for you. 

## Setup
When you run compilation for the first time or do `./tools/builder --init` `builder.cfg` appears in your project folder.  
Edit it to set build/test/upload options. The config contains the necessary comments inside.  

Edit the files in the `PublicationContent` folder - they are responsible for the description in the Steam Workshop.  

## Project filesystem
If you have *.upk or localization files, they must be in a specific location.  

Change the filesystem of the project to such a form that everything works correctly:  
```
/SomePackageName1
    *.upk
    /Classes
        *.uc
        *.upkg
/SomePackageName2
    *.upk
    /Classes
        *.uc
        *.upkg
/PublicationContent
    preview.png
    description.txt
    tags.txt
    title.txt
/Localization
    /INT
        *.int
/Config
    *.ini
/BrewedPC
	*.*
/tools
    builder
builder.cfg
```

**Note:** Use the `BrewedPC` folder for additional content such as sound files for your weapons or other stuff. This will be copied to the final BrewedPC before being uploaded to the workshop.  
By the way, this allows you to use a script to upload maps (although this was not its original purpose). Just put the map(s) in `BrewedPC` (don't forget to edit the `PublicationContent`) and run `./tools/builder -u`.

## Examples (Projects that use KF2-BuildTools)
**Simplest case (one mutator):**  
- [AdminAutoLogin](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-AdminAutoLogin)

**Three mutators are compiled (one of them is a dependency),**  
**two mutators are uploaded to the steam workshop:**
